This results in a higher chance of defending from a telepathic attack, meaning he can save in advantage whenever an opponent tries to telepathically attack him. Also, if Flash Thompson’s mind is subdued, the symbiote will take over the body and will still be free of said control.","Symbiote Prosthetic: If Flash is already missing a limb, Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom can recreate it as a symbiote prosthetic and maintain it indefinitely while possessing the symbiote and, when separating from it, losing said limb again.","Disguise: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom can morph his external appearance to resemble another person. For this, he must pass a Charisma check of 15. Also, the symbiote can transform into any kind of non-armor clothing.","Web-Swinging: As a bonus action, Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom can move 60 ft. with his organic web swinging ability.","Regenerative Symbiote Healing: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom has a powerful regenerative healing factor that allows him to heal 1d4 each turn on level 1. His dice increases into 1d6 at level 5, then 1d8 at level 10, 1d10 at level 15 and 1d12 at level 20. He can instantly reattach body parts after losing them or, if in battle, spend a turn for it. If he gets decapitated, he can stay alive if he succeeds on a Durability save of 25. This power is only effective while wearing the symbiote suit.","Pistols: Anti-Venom has 2 Baretta M9 as his basic equipment.","Spider-Sense Immunity: Being previously bonded to Spider-man, Agent Venom developed the ability to act without activating Spider-man's Spider-Sense, and due to the genetic memory, so can Agent Anti-Venom.","ESP: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom possesses an extrasensory ability like a Spider-Sense, meaning he can’t be attacked by surprise. For every first attack against him, he can save to agility to evade the upcoming attack. He doesn’t have to check perception against invisible characters.","Cloaking: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom has the ability of merging with his surroundings, making him almost invisible. To achieve a successful cloaking, he must save to Agility. If Venom’s save is 20 or more, he can move while camouflaged and can make a Sneak Attack.","Constituent-Matter Manipulation: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom can morph his body parts into all kinds of melee weapons or enlarge his fists, giving him double damage on regular melee attacks but having to save to Agility when picking up a breakable item. If failed, the item will break. This can’t be done while in battle."],"weaknesses":["Sensitive Hearing: Agent Venom is vulnerable to loud sounds and high frequencies. This means that whenever he receives sonic damage, it will be counted as critical. When hit with a sound attack, his attacks are made in disadvantage for a turn and his Defense drops to 5, for a turn as well.","Fire: Agent Venom is vulnerable to fire or high temperatures. This means that whenever he is attacked with burning attacks, damage will be counted as critical. Also, his attacks are made in disadvantage for a turn and, if he gets “burned” status effect, he will get all his stats halved, rounded to down, until the effect is removed.
