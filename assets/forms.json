Because of this, the bleeding edge armor uses nanite points (NP), which represents the amount of nanites used by the armor. Instead of HP the armor’s integrity is represented by NP. Whenever his armor NP is low, tony can use some of his spare nanites in his chest to restore the amor’s integrity. If the armor’s NP is less than 10, Tony’s body is exposed, and it has 20% chance of receiving direct damage. Tony can also use some NP to use special morphing powers. Nanites used for this powers will return to the chest reactor once Tony stops using them. However, there’s a 50% chance of tony losing those nanites when attacked while those powers are active. The percentage of nanites lost from the attack is given by 1d100. Tony has 100 NP stored in his chest unit. The base armor NP increases just like health when leveling up."

            "Enhanced Immune System: Due to the symbiote’s healing properties, Agent Venom has a higher tolerance for diseases and higher cure probability than normal humans, giving him an extra d6 in every Durability check when trying to resist and an extra d8 when trying to cure.",
            "Genetic Memory: The symbiote possesses some psychic ability, being capable of establishing a neural connection between its host and another character by direct physical contact, enabling him to effectively read minds.",
            "Dual Mind: Agent Venom possesses two consciousness in his mind, Flash Thompson’s and the symbiote’s. This results in a higher chance of defending from a telepathic attack, meaning he can save in advantage whenever an opponent tries to telepathically attack him. Also, if Flash Thompson’s mind is subdued, the symbiote will take over the body and will still be free of said control.",
            "Symbiote Prosthetic: If Flash is already missing a limb, Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom can recreate it as a symbiote prosthetic and maintain it indefinitely while possessing the symbiote and, when separating from it, losing said limb again.",
            "Disguise: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom can morph his external appearance to resemble another person. For this, he must pass a Charisma check of 15. Also, the symbiote can transform into any kind of non-armor clothing.",
            "Web-Swinging: As a bonus action, Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom can move 60 ft. with his organic web swinging ability.",
            "Regenerative Symbiote Healing: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom has a powerful regenerative healing factor that allows him to heal 1d4 each turn on level 1. His dice increases into 1d6 at level 5, then 1d8 at level 10, 1d10 at level 15 and 1d12 at level 20. He can instantly reattach body parts after losing them or, if in battle, spend a turn for it. If he gets decapitated, he can stay alive if he succeeds on a Durability save of 25. This power is only effective while wearing the symbiote suit.",
            "Pistols: Anti-Venom has 2 Baretta M9 as his basic equipment.",
            "Spider-Sense Immunity: Being previously bonded to Spider-man, Agent Venom developed the ability to act without activating Spider-man's Spider-Sense, and due to the genetic memory, so can Agent Anti-Venom.",
            "ESP: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom possesses an extrasensory ability like a Spider-Sense, meaning he can’t be attacked by surprise. For every first attack against him, he can save to agility to evade the upcoming attack. He doesn’t have to check perception against invisible characters.",
            "Cloaking: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom has the ability of merging with his surroundings, making him almost invisible. To achieve a successful cloaking, he must save to Agility. If Venom’s save is 20 or more, he can move while camouflaged and can make a Sneak Attack.",
            "Constituent-Matter Manipulation: Agent Venom/Agent Anti-Venom can morph his body parts into all kinds of melee weapons or enlarge his fists, giving him double damage on regular melee attacks but having to save to Agility when picking up a breakable item. If failed, the item will break. This can’t be done while in battle."

            "Fire: Agent Venom is vulnerable to fire or high temperatures. This means that whenever he is attacked with burning attacks, damage will be counted as critical. Also, his attacks are made in disadvantage for a turn and, if he gets “burned” status effect, he will get all his stats halved, rounded to down, until the effect is removed. "

When attacking an invisible character, Spider-man can estimate their location, so he doesn’t need a perception throw to attempt an attack. However, the attack is still thrown in disadvantage.",
            "Web Swinging: As a bonus action, Spider-man can move 60 ft. with his web swinging ability. This can’t be done on a very open space.",
            "Indomitable Will: As a result of a strong willpower, Spider-man has an increased resistance against enemy temptations, giving him a +4 in his saving throws when defeated in tense situations once each long rest. He also gets a +5 bonus in any check when being telepathically controlled and he is immune to being charmed. He is immune to purple control.",
            "Radioactive Immune System: Due to his accelerated metabolism and radioactive blood, Spider-Man has higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, giving him an extra d6 in every Durability check when trying to resist diseases, drug effects and overdoses. Also, he saves in advantage when trying to resist curse diseases, such as vampirism. It’s harder for him to get drunk, but he doesn’t drink too much anyways. He throws in advantage to save from paralysis and can’t be irradiated",

This can happen in any activity, even in a battle, and these checks can happen at the GM’s discretion while they happen at least within 24 hours.",
            "Ethyl Chloride: Due to his spider-like physiology, Spider-man is susceptible to this chemical pesticide. Spraying him directly will deal 1d8 damage and half, rounded down, his Acrobatics skill for a turn. Any incoming attack with a weapon imbued in it will have an extra d6 of damage.",
            "Web Shooter Capacity: Every time spider-man uses one of his web attacks, he uses some of his web fluid. He usually carries with 10 clips of web fluid. Each power that uses webs consumes a certain quantity of a web fluid clip. Blue powers consume 10% of the clip, green powers consume 20% of the clip, yellow powers consume 30% of the clip, red powers consume 40% of the clip and his extreme power consume 50% of the clip. Each time spider-man uses 100% of a clip, he must use an action to change the clip for a new one. When spider-man runs out of all 10 clips, he won’t be able to use his web powers until a long rest, where he produces more web fluid."

He has in some cases, been known to occasionally spar with other heroes; in one case, Strange was able to evade a kung fu hand-chop by Mantis (the future mother of the Quoi), only three others have ever done, and who has been able to subdue Thor in sheer physical combat, despite his strength nearly hundreds of times superior to her own.

By forming a jet from his feet, directed behind him, he can achieve a normal flight speed of 50 ft per turn.",

Thus, he can’t use his plasma mode in outer space. The Torch's flame can be extinguished by smothering materials, such as water, sand, fire-fighting foam, and heat-resistant blankets, unless his flame is at such an intensity that it immediately vaporizes such materials on contact. If a character tries to use any of these materials to extinguish his fire, he can attempt a Thermokinesis throw of 14 to maintain his plasma mode on. If hit with small amounts of water, up to about five gallons, the Torch can turn it to steam with relatively little effort. More water than that could extinguish his flame at its normal level, and he would have to wait until he could evaporate the residual moisture before re-ignition. He can’t turn into the torch underwater."

Also, he saves in advantage when trying to resist curse diseases, such as vampirism. It’s harder for him to get drunk, but he doesn’t drink too much anyways. He throws in advantage to save from paralysis and can’t be irradiated",

As a result, Storm has in the past kept a tight rein on all extreme emotions. In a tense situation, the GM can ask storm for a wisdom check. If failed, she will create a destructive storm that damages foes and allies as well, dealing 2d10 damage to all of them.",
            "Physical Condition: Storm is limited by the force of her will and the strength of her body. It once took her several hours to put an end to a savage blizzard sweeping over much of Canada, and she nearly killed herself from exhaustion in the process. Using her power continuously for more than 2 hours will start to drain her health in 20 hp per hour.",
            "Naturally Occurring Limitation: Storm respects the natural boundaries of the planet's biosphere and manipulates weather patterns as they naturally exist. For example, she could end a drought in one area by creating torrential rains there, but that would necessitate robbing all available moisture from the surrounding area. (In contrast, Thor, whose weather affecting ability is magical, can change the weather in one area without disrupting existing weather patterns anywhere else). Storm does not typically create atmospheric conditions that cannot exist naturally on the planet she is on. She could not, for example, lower temperatures as far as absolute zero or raise them to solar intensities."

Each two level up, the dice gets bigger until it reaches d12 at level 9. Then, an extra d4 is gained and the process repeats until level 19 is reached, where it gets 2d12. Additionally, he can regenerate body parts after losing them. If he is in possession of his lost limb, he can re-attach it and fixing time will be 1d10 minutes or, if in battle, 1d4 turns. If the limb is lost, he must wait an amount of 1d20 hours for it to fully grow again and, in the case of a hand or arm, a third of that time to partially grow and being able only to hold small objects. If he gets decapitated, he can stay alive if he succeeds on a Durability check of 23 and someone else must help him to reattach his head to his body. If in battle, the one helping him will spend an entire turn just helping him. If his head is lost, he can regrow it if he succeeds a Durability save of 25 and it will take him 3d12 hours to fully recover. If fallen, he just needs two successes to wake up.",

The device contains a built-in gauge that shows how many times can the device be used. Initially, the device only has one use before emptying out, but as Deadpool levels up, the device also improves, adding an additional use at levels 5, 10, 15 and 20. Each use takes 4 seconds to recharge, or a full turn, when in combat, and if the gauge goes to zero then the device has to recharge fully before being usable again. Deadpool can also spend more than one use at a time to achieve a greater teleportation distance, adding 20 more ft but spending another use. If Deadpool wants to use any of the additional uses to go to a place that was not in sight from his initial position, he must save to 15 Agility or the teleportation chain will be interrupted and he will no longer be able to teleport on that same turn. (He can perform an additional save to 20 Luck at the GM discretion). This device can also be used to evade an upcoming attack as a reaction. However, he needs to achieve a perception check higher than the attacker’s throw and it spends three uses of the device. ",

Every action attempted by her can be thrown using the luck skill, and every action attempted against her will be thrown in disadvantage. The GM must have in mind that her success in different scenarios is not due to her skill, and it is just pure luck. Domino cannot consciously control her ability, so it’s only up to the game master to tell how the events unfold. However, it is also largely participatory - for the luck to take effect, Domino herself must engage in an action whose chance she can affect. For example, if debris falling from the sky was about to hit her in the head, she would still be hurt if she stood still. However, if she tried to avoid them, she would move perfectly to avoid each piece about to hit her. In addition, if Domino were to stand before a hail of bullets, she would be a bullet-ridden corpse. Instead, she must act; in attempting to avoid the gunfire, she will miraculously dodge just right to avoid every single shot.",

            "Flight: The Human Torch's plasma has a high hydrogen content and is surrounded by an exuded cloud of mono-atomic hydrogen atoms. The hot cloud provides sufficient positive buoyancy for him to float. With mental stimulation of his flame, he can provide enough lift to carry around 180 pounds. By forming a jet from his feet, directed behind him, he can achieve a normal flight speed of 50 ft per turn.",
            "Immunity to Fire & Heat: The Human Torch is unaffected by heat and flames, including his own, even when part of him is aflame and the rest of him is not. His flesh cannot be scalded or burned by any heat source whose level is below that of his maximum output.",
            "Plasma Form: As a bonus action, The Human Torch can turn into plasma. In this state, his body is no longer solid, firearm damage is reduced in half and every successful physical attack against him will deal 1d8 fire damage to the attacker. He can also deactivate plasma mode as a bonus action. Plasma mode’s duration depends on Jim’s health. If he has less than 30% of his health, his flame form will wear off in the next 2 turns, and he will have to wait for 3 turns to be able to turn into plasma again. While in this form, his normal attacks deal fire damage and if he deals a successful combo against another character, he will leave them burned.",

            "Fire Extinguishing: The Human Torch's flame is supported by the presence of oxygen, and thus is extinguished in low air pressure or a vacuum. Thus, he can’t use his plasma mode in outer space. The Torch's flame can be extinguished by smothering materials, such as water, sand, fire-fighting foam, and heat-resistant blankets, unless his flame is at such an intensity that it immediately vaporizes such materials on contact. If a character tries to use any of these materials to extinguish his fire, he can attempt a Thermokinesis throw of 14 to maintain his plasma mode on. If hit with small amounts of water, up to about five gallons, the Torch can turn it to steam with relatively little effort. More water than that could extinguish his flame at its normal level, and he would have to wait until he could evaporate the residual moisture before re-ignition. He can’t turn into the torch underwater."
