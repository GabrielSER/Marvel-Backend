Whenever she is trapped on small places, she becomes frightened.","Emotional Influence: Storm's ability to manipulate the weather in her immediate vicinity is affected by her emotions; hence, if she does not maintain control, a fit of rage might induce a destructive storm. As a result, Storm has in the past kept a tight rein on all extreme emotions. In a tense situation, the GM can ask storm for a wisdom check. If failed, she will create a destructive storm that damages foes and allies as well, dealing 2d10 damage to all of them.","Physical Condition: Storm is limited by the force of her will and the strength of her body. It once took her several hours to put an end to a savage blizzard sweeping over much of Canada, and she nearly killed herself from exhaustion in the process. Using her power continuously for more than 2 hours will start to drain her health in 20 hp per hour.","Naturally Occurring Limitation: Storm respects the natural boundaries of the planet's biosphere and manipulates weather patterns as they naturally exist. For example, she could end a drought in one area by creating torrential rains there, but that would necessitate robbing all available moisture from the surrounding area. (In contrast, Thor, whose weather affecting ability is magical, can change the weather in one area without disrupting existing weather patterns anywhere else). Storm does not typically create atmospheric conditions that cannot exist naturally on the planet she is on. She could not, for example, lower temperatures as far as absolute zero or raise them to solar intensities."],"types":["hero"],"powers":["63f4574b7cd99b959c9c36d2","63f457687cd99b959c9c36d5","63f4578a7cd99b959c9c36d8","63f457b17cd99b959c9c36db","63f457ca7cd99b959c9c36de","63f457df7cd99b959c9c36e1","63f457f37cd99b959c9c36e4","63f458197cd99b959c9c36e7"],"forms":[],"order":35,"createdAt":"2023-02-14T00:53:50.699Z","updatedAt":"2023-07-09T22:10:05.532Z"},{"stats":{"strength":2,"intelligence":3,"durability":2,"agility":5,"wisdom":4,"charisma":3,"perception":5,"hp":60,"power":2,"defense":13,"melee":5,"energyprojection":1,"speed":30,"luck":2},"skills":{"acrobatics":5,"accuracy":3,"athletics":2,"aerialPiloting":4,"bikePiloting":1,"heavyEquipmentPiloting":0,"lockpicking":4,"meleeWeapons":5,"motorVehiclePiloting":0,"pickpocket":4,"rangedWeapons":4,"stealth":4,"throw":0,"underwater":0,"waterPiloting":0,"animalHandling":0,"arcana":0,"deception":0,"espionage":2,"etiquette":0,"explosives":0,"firstAid":6,"firearms":0,"electronicsKnowledge":0,"historyKnowledge":0,"intimidation":2,"intuition":3,"investigation":1,"marksman":0,"mechanic":4,"medicine":3,"naturalSciencesKnowledge":3,"persuasion":0,"religion":5,"softwareKnowledge":0,"survivalist":0,"tracking":3},"specialSkills":{"willpower":0,"bodyStretching":0,"enviromentalAwareness":0,"flight":0,"magic":0,"chiControl":0,"magnetism":0,"telepathy":0,"pyrokinesis":0,"electrokinesis":0,"cryokinesis":0,"gravitokinesis":0,"hydrokinesis":0,"aerokinesis":0,"seismokinesis":0,"terrakinesis":0,"thermokinesis":0,"powerCosmic":0,"spiritualAffinity":0,"weatherControl":0,"wallCrawling":5,"special1":0,"special2":0,"special3":0,"special4":0},"type":["hero"],"_id":"63eaea40cd5d9522b8e5048f","name":"Nightcrawler","alterego":"Kurt Wagner","description":"Kurt Wagner is a demonic-looking mutant with teleporting abilities, being known as the soft-hearted X-Man Nightcrawler.

I mean...True Believers! Brought to you by me, myself, and I: the fabulous Deadpool! I could have let some smelly pencil-pushing intern spell out my life story for you, but you deserve better. So, here it is, straight from the Merc with a Mouth's mouth—every detail of my morally ambiguous, mentally unstable, innuendo-laden past. From my very first appearance in NEW MUTANTS #98, to my latest booty-kicking, comic relief-ing anti-heroics, to a third thing that I can't think of right now, this is the definitive history of Deadpool. Like any misunderstood hero, I probably had a difficult childhood that led to my career as a professional killer. That, or someone brainwashed me into murdering my parents. If I don't remember, does it really count? Or matter?. Let's just say that I was an orphan, a wizard put me on my aunt and uncle's doorstep, they raised me in secret, and then I went to a special magic school where a bald man regularly tried to murder me with voodoo. Okay, that's not true...but I do have a scar on my forehead! Several, actually! Anyway, seriously, I joined the military at 17 years-old, but was discharged soon thereafter. So, naturally, I decided to become an assassin (which is, by the way, an incredibly fun word to write). Then I met Wade and Mercedes Wilson, a young couple that nursed me back to health after an early failed job. Some may say that I killed them both in an attempt to steal Wade's identity, but guys, come on. I'm the real Wade Wilson. While working as a hired gun, I met the expensively beautiful Vanessa Carlyle, and we made a perfectly dysfunctional pair. I then got an assignment to kill a British operative named Althea (important moment readers, I'm meeting my best friend here) but decided to kill everyone else instead. Doing this made my employers...unhappy. So they tried to kill Vanessa. Luckily, a special agent named Zoe Culloden—who'd been spying on me to try and convert me into some kind of messiah protector—rescued Vanessa. Weird subplot, I know. Cue my first life-defining moment: they gave me inoperable cancer. Low blow. I dumped Vanessa and joined a Weapon X program, where a few experiments served me up fresh and cancer free—with a side order of healing powers. Mmm, tasty! I joined their internal team of mercenaries, but my powers had some performance issues, so the department sent me off to die quietly in a place called Hospice. As if a painful, slow death could shut this mouth up. Clearly, these guys hadn't read any of my supporting literature. There were a few other guys stuck in there with me, and we had a betting pool over who would kick the bucket first. We called it the dead pool, and because I'm a clever girl and because my name needed some kind of logic behind it, I adopted the moniker Deadpool. What? No, I disagree, it's not a reach at all. I got many enemies with the years, and many people have tried to kill me. But it didn't work because I'm still here. Writing this character biography. Doing work an intern should be doing. Not getting paid. In any case, if you are going to play as me. Do it right! Or I'll get out of this game and I'll kill you, and you know I will! Okay. Uhh? How do I end this. Umm? Oh! I know. The truth is... I am Iron Man.","logo":"https://i.ibb.co/Ss5xv4s/Deadpool.png","image":"https://i.ibb.co/fCLgFcP/Deadpool.webp","abilities":["Regenerative Healing Factor: Deadpool has a powerful regenerative healing factor that allows him to heal 1d4 each turn on level 1. Each two level up, the dice gets bigger until it reaches d12 at level 9. Then, an extra d4 is gained and the process repeats until level 19 is reached, where it gets 2d12. Additionally, he can regenerate body parts after losing them. If he is in possession of his lost limb, he can re-attach it and fixing time will be 1d10 minutes or, if in battle, 1d4 turns. If the limb is lost, he must wait an amount of 1d20 hours for it to fully grow again and, in the case of a hand or arm, a third of that time to partially grow and being able only to hold small objects. If he gets decapitated, he can stay alive if he succeeds on a Durability check of 23 and someone else must help him to reattach his head to his body. If in battle, the one helping him will spend an entire turn just helping him. If his head is lost, he can regrow it if he succeeds a Durability save of 25 and it will take him 3d12 hours to fully recover.

Also, he can unsheathe weapons with both hands during combat with no Action penalty and his Bonus Action allows him to change weapons on both hands.","Unpredictability: Given that not even Deadpool himself knows what he’ll do next, nobody can predict his movements or actions, meaning that he can disengage without being vulnerable to opportunity attacks.","Possession Immunity: Deadpool is immune to possession. You can’t touch his soul.","Teleportation Device: Deadpool's belt buckle is in reality a teleportation device that allows him to teleport anywhere in sight on a 20 ft radius as a bonus action. The device contains a built-in gauge that shows how many times can the device be used. Initially, the device only has one use before emptying out, but as Deadpool levels up, the device also improves, adding an additional use at levels 5, 10, 15 and 20. Each use takes 4 seconds to recharge, or a full turn, when in combat, and if the gauge goes to zero then the device has to recharge fully before being usable again. Deadpool can also spend more than one use at a time to achieve a greater teleportation distance, adding 20 more ft but spending another use. If Deadpool wants to use any of the additional uses to go to a place that was not in sight from his initial position, he must save to 15 Agility or the teleportation chain will be interrupted and he will no longer be able to teleport on that same turn. (He can perform an additional save to 20 Luck at the GM discretion). This device can also be used to evade an upcoming attack as a reaction. However, he needs to achieve a perception check higher than the attacker’s throw and it spends three uses of the device.

The GM must have in mind that her success in different scenarios is not due to her skill, and it is just pure luck. Domino cannot consciously control her ability, so it’s only up to the game master to tell how the events unfold. However, it is also largely participatory - for the luck to take effect, Domino herself must engage in an action whose chance she can affect.

Horton for scientific purposes. At a press-conference unveiling, however, Horton's creation burst into flames when exposed to oxygen, and, with human-like sentience, personality, and awareness, rebelled against his creator. Public outcry led to the Torch's being sealed in concrete, which Horton did until he could find a way to control the android's flames, though he eventually escaped due to a crack that let oxygen seep in. While the Torch then inadvertently caused parts of New York City to burn, he eventually learned to control his flame and vowed to help humanity. He would join other heroes like Captain America, Namor and the other Invaders, as war broke out in Europe, and later in the Pacific, to fight the Axis powers. During this time he acquired a young partner, Thomas “Toro“ Raymond and battles by his side for years.","logo":"https://i.ibb.co/NNCm8NF/Torch.png","image":"https://i.ibb.co/cQyBNQr/Torch.jpg","abilities":["Flight: The Human Torch's plasma has a high hydrogen content and is surrounded by an exuded cloud of mono-atomic hydrogen atoms. The hot cloud provides sufficient positive buoyancy for him to float. With mental stimulation of his flame, he can provide enough lift to carry around 180 pounds. By forming a jet from his feet, directed behind him, he can achieve a normal flight speed of 50 ft per turn.","Immunity to Fire & Heat: The Human Torch is unaffected by heat and flames, including his own, even when part of him is aflame and the rest of him is not. His flesh cannot be scalded or burned by any heat source whose level is below that of his maximum output.","Plasma Form: As a bonus action, The Human Torch can turn into plasma.

Thus, he can’t use his plasma mode in outer space. The Torch's flame can be extinguished by smothering materials, such as water, sand, fire-fighting foam, and heat-resistant blankets, unless his flame is at such an intensity that it immediately vaporizes such materials on contact. If a character tries to use any of these materials to extinguish his fire, he can attempt a Thermokinesis throw of 14 to maintain his plasma mode on. If hit with small amounts of water, up to about five gallons, the Torch can turn it to steam with relatively little effort. More water than that could extinguish his flame at its normal level, and he would have to wait until he could evaporate the residual moisture before re-ignition.

Kenneth was the son of Lord and Lady Crichton and the grandson of Lord Falsworth. Despite coming from different worlds the two struck up a close friendship. It was during a visit to Kenneth's ancestral home Falsworth manor that he was told the family secret: Both Kenny's grandfather and late uncle had worn the heroic mantle of Union Jack, while Ken's mother had been the superheroine Spitfire; also that the black sheep of the family Lord Falsworth's brother had been the vampiric German agent Baron Blood. Also visiting the Manor was family friend Steve Rogers who was summoned by Montgomery to help investigate the return of Baron Blood.They didn't have to wait long for the Baron soon entered the manor disguised as the local doctor, intending to turn his wheelchair-bound brother into one of the undead, condemning Montgomery to an eternity as a crippled old man. Lord Falsworth intended to act as bait by luring his brother into a trap, but he suffered a heart attack and was too weak to carry it out. It was decided that Joey would take Kenneth's place as Union Jack, as Kenneth would not have been strong enough to survive the fight.When the Baron was left alone with whom he thought to be his brother, he moved in for the kill; but then Chapman exploded out of the bed and launched a surprise attack against the vampire. Captain America entered the fray shortly afterward, and even though Chapman's inexperience in fighting vampires would work against him, the two valiantly fought Blood, and the Baron was eventually decapitated by Captain America's shield. Recognizing how he had earned it, the Falsworth's decided to allow Joey to continue as the new Union Jack.
